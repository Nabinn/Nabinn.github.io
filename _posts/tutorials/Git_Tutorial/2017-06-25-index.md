According to Wikipedia:

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class HelloWorld{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello World");
}
	public void demo(){
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		System.out.println("Hello World");

Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

```java
public class HelloWorld{
	
	public static void main(String[] args){

		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.

```python
import os
os.system('clear')
print("Python syntax highlighting")
a=5
```
